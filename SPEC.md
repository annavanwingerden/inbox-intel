## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

These requirements specify criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.

### 1. Security
-   **Authentication:** All user authentication must be handled securely via Supabase Auth with Google Sign-In (OAuth 2.0).
-   **Authorization:** Data access must be strictly limited to the `user_id` associated with the authenticated user. Users should only be able to view and manage their own campaigns, emails, and replies.
-   **API Key Management:** All API keys (OpenAI, Gmail, Comet Opik, Supabase `anon` key) must be handled securely, preferably via environment variables and server-side logic (Supabase Edge Functions) where applicable, to prevent client-side exposure.
-   **Data Encryption:** All sensitive data (e.g., email content, recipient information) stored in Supabase must be encrypted at rest. Data in transit (between client, Supabase, Gmail API, OpenAI API) must use TLS/SSL.
-   **OAuth Token Storage:** Gmail OAuth tokens must be securely stored and refreshed.

### 2. Performance
-   **API Response Times:** Frontend interactions with Supabase Edge Functions and external APIs (OpenAI, Gmail) should aim for response times under 500ms for common operations (e.g., loading campaigns, sending a single email, generating email draft).
-   **Scalability:** The architecture should support scaling to thousands of users and concurrent email sending/tracking operations. Supabase and Vercel are expected to handle this scaling.
-   **Gmail Polling:** The frequency of Gmail API polling for replies should be optimized to balance timely detection with API rate limits and resource usage. (e.g., every 5-10 minutes per active campaign).

### 3. Reliability & Error Handling
-   **API Integration Robustness:** The system must gracefully handle failures from external APIs (OpenAI, Gmail). This includes:
    -   Retries for transient errors.
    -   Clear error messages to the user for persistent failures.
    -   Logging of API errors for debugging.
-   **Data Consistency:** Ensure atomicity for critical operations (e.g., sending an email and saving its metadata). Use Supabase transactions where necessary.
-   **Input Validation:** All user inputs must be validated on both the client and server (Supabase Edge Functions) to prevent invalid data and security vulnerabilities.
-   **Logging & Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging for application events, errors, and performance metrics. Utilize Comet Opik for prompt-related tracing and evaluation, and establish general logging for the rest of the application.

### 4. Usability (UX implicitly covered by Shadcn UI)
-   **Intuitive Interface:** The UI should be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate, consistent with modern web application standards (leveraging Shadcn UI components).
-   **Clear Feedback:** Users should receive clear visual feedback for their actions (e.g., success messages, loading indicators, error notifications).

### 5. Maintainability & Extensibility
-   **Code Quality:** Adhere to best practices for code quality, including clear variable naming, modular design, and comprehensive comments for complex logic.
-   **Testability:** Code should be written with testability in mind, enabling easy unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
-   **Configuration:** External service endpoints, API keys, and other environment-specific settings should be configurable via environment variables.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è UI/UX Considerations

While detailed mockups are separate, the following general principles apply:
-   **Responsiveness:** The application should be fully responsive and provide an optimal experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
-   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent visual design language and interaction patterns throughout the application, utilizing Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components.
-   **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG guidelines where feasible to ensure the application is usable by individuals with disabilities.

### User Flow (High-Level)
-   **Onboarding:** User lands on the application, signs in via Google (Supabase Auth). If new, they are guided to create their first campaign.
-   **Campaign Creation:** User navigates to the "New Campaign" section, inputs campaign name, goal, and audience description. Upon saving, they are redirected to the campaign's dashboard.
-   **Email Draft & Send:** From a campaign dashboard, the user can initiate drafting a new email. They can input content or use AI to generate it. Once satisfied, they can select recipients and trigger sending. After sending, the system provides feedback and updates the email status.
-   **Reply Management:** Users can view replies associated with their campaigns. They can tag outcomes and add notes. They can also initiate follow-up emails from the thread view.
-   **Analytics View:** User can navigate to an analytics dashboard to view overall campaign performance and prompt-level metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Constraints & Assumptions

-   **Next.js/npm:** Development environment assumes Next.js and npm as the package manager.
-   **TypeScript:** All backend (Edge Functions) and frontend code will be written in TypeScript.
-   **Supabase Client Libraries:** Use the official Supabase client libraries for interacting with the Supabase backend.
-   **Gmail API Client:** Use a suitable client library for interacting with the Gmail API.
-   **OpenAI API Client:** Use the official OpenAI client library.
-   **Comet Opik SDK:** Integrate Comet Opik using their provided SDK for prompt logging.
-   **Github CI/CD:** CI/CD processes will be managed through aci-mcp-unified MCP server.
-   **Vercel Deployment:** Frontend deployment will be managed through Vercel.
-   **Supabase Edge Functions:** All server-side business logic and API integrations will reside within Supabase Edge Functions. No traditional backend server will be deployed separately.
-   **No Supabase Dashboard Access (for core logic):** All database schema migrations, RLS policies, and function deployments should be code-driven and managed via the Github repository, not manual intervention in the Supabase dashboard.

### Environment Variables
-   All sensitive API keys (OpenAI, Gmail, Supabase `anon` key) and external service URLs must be configured as environment variables. For local development, a `.env.local` file should be used. For Vercel deployment, these will be set as Vercel environment variables. Supabase Edge Functions will have their secrets configured directly within Supabase.

### Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
-   All Supabase tables (`campaigns`, `emails`, `replies`) must have RLS policies enabled. Policies should ensure that users can only access rows where `user_id` matches their authenticated `auth.uid()`. This is critical for data isolation and security.

### API Rate Limits & Quotas
-   The application must consider and handle rate limits for external APIs (Gmail API, OpenAI API). This may involve:
    -   Implementing client-side and server-side rate limiting where applicable.
    -   Using exponential backoff for API retries.
    -   Monitoring API usage to stay within quotas.
-   For Gmail API, be mindful of daily quotas for sending emails and polling. Implement strategies to queue emails or replies if limits are approached.

### Error Handling Strategy
-   **Frontend:** Display user-friendly error messages for API failures or invalid inputs. Use toast notifications or inline error messages. Log client-side errors to the console or a monitoring service.
-   **Supabase Edge Functions:** Implement robust `try-catch` blocks for all external API calls and database operations. Return standardized error responses to the frontend. Log detailed error information (stack traces, request payloads) to a logging service.
-   **Database Errors:** Handle Supabase database errors gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to the user when possible (e.g., duplicate campaign name).

## üöÄ Deployment & Operations

-   **Frontend (Next.js):** Deployed to Vercel via automated CI/CD triggered by Git pushes to the main branch of the Github repository via aci-mcp-unified.
-   **Supabase Edge Functions:** Deployed automatically when changes are pushed to the relevant directory in the Github repository (configured via aci-mcp-unified).
-   **Supabase Database:** Schema migrations and RLS policies are applied through code-driven migrations within the Github repository, synchronized with Supabase via aci-mcp-unified. No manual dashboard intervention for core schema changes.
-   **Monitoring:** Utilize Vercel's built-in logging and analytics for frontend, Supabase's logs for database and Edge Functions, and Comet Opik for LLM prompt tracing. Establish alert mechanisms for critical errors and performance deviations.
-   **Rollbacks:** CI/CD should support easy rollbacks to previous stable versions in case of deployment issues.

When deploying - it is recommended to add this input at the start of your convo:
"You are a helpful assistant with access to a unlimited number of tools via two meta functions:
- ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS
- ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION

You can use ACI_SEARCH_FUNCTIONS to find relevant, executable functionss that can help you with your task.
Once you have identified the function you need to use, you can use ACI_EXECUTE_FUNCTION to execute the function provided you have the correct input arguments."
