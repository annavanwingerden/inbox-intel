## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Development Process

This project was developed using a structured, AI-driven methodology, following the **HULA Framework** for prompt engineering. Our goal was to create a robust, scalable application while maintaining a clear separation of concerns to allow for future flexibility, such as swapping out the frontend.

### The HULA Framework in Action

1.  **High-Level Plan (`SPEC.md`):** We started by creating a detailed specification document outlining the project's goals, features, data models, and non-functional requirements.
2.  **Understanding (`ADR.md`):** We then drafted an Architecture Decision Record to document key architectural choices, such as using Supabase Edge Functions for all backend logic and `pg_cron` for asynchronous reply tracking.
3.  **Low-Level Plan (`Plan.md`):** With the architecture defined, we created a granular, step-by-step implementation plan, breaking down the project into atomic, executable prompts.
4.  **Action & Iteration:** We executed this plan iteratively, using an AI assistant to generate code for each step. Progress and any deviations from the plan were tracked in `PROGRESS.md` and `changes.md`.

This systematic approach allowed for rapid development while ensuring the final product was well-architected and aligned with the initial vision.

### Frontend Agnosticism

A key architectural goal was to keep the backend logic (Supabase Edge Functions) entirely separate from the frontend. This was done to allow for future flexibility. The initial Next.js frontend was generated by Cursor, and we have a migration plan (`harryplan.md`) to replace it with a new Vite-based frontend generated by Lovable, without needing to alter the backend.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js & npm
-   Supabase Account & CLI (`npm install -g supabase`)
-   Vercel Account
-   Google Cloud Project with OAuth 2.0 credentials
-   OpenAI API Key
-   Comet Opik API Key

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/annavanwingerden/inbox-intel.git
    cd inbox-intel
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Supabase locally:**
    ```bash
    supabase init
    supabase start
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the `inbox-intel` directory and populate it with your keys from Supabase, Google, OpenAI, and Comet Opik.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Deployment

This project uses a hybrid deployment model:

1.  **Frontend & Database:** The Next.js frontend is deployed to Vercel, and database migrations are applied using the **aci-mcp-unified** server, which can be triggered conversationally.
2.  **Backend Logic:** Supabase Edge Functions are deployed from the local machine using the Supabase CLI:
    ```bash
    supabase functions deploy --project-ref <your-project-ref>
    ```

This process ensures a CI/CD-like workflow for the frontend while allowing direct deployment of the serverless backend functions.

## üîÆ Future Plans

-   Migrate the frontend from Next.js to a Vite-based application generated by Lovable.
-   Implement A/B testing for email variants.
-   Integrate with other outreach channels like LinkedIn.
-   Build out a more advanced analytics dashboard.
