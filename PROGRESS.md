# InboxIntel - Project Progress Summary

This document summarizes the development progress for the InboxIntel application, intended to provide a clear starting point for future work.

## Project Context

We are building **InboxIntel**, a cold outreach tool, following a detailed implementation plan (`PLAN.md`). The architecture (`ADR.md`) is based on a Next.js frontend, a Supabase backend (Database, Edge Functions), and Vercel for deployment, managed via a hybrid of the `aci-mcp-unified` server and the Supabase CLI.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Phase 1: Project Foundation & Authentication
*   **Project Initialization:** Next.js project created with Git.
*   **UI Component Setup:** All `shadcn` components (`button`, `card`, `input`, etc.) were created manually after the CLI proved unstable.
*   **Supabase Client:** Client configured in `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`. A `.env.local` file must be created manually.
*   **Auth Flow:** The `/login` page was created, and route protection middleware was implemented along with a sign-out flow on the main page.

### Completed Phase 2: Database Schema and Security
*   **Database Setup:** The `campaigns`, `emails`, and `replies` tables were all successfully created by executing SQL queries via the `aci-mcp-unified` server's `SUPABASE__RUN_SQL_QUERY` function.
*   **Row Level Security:** RLS policies were successfully applied to all tables using the same `SUPABASE__RUN_SQL_QUERY` function, ensuring users can only access their own data.

### Completed Phase 3: Campaign Management (Backend & Frontend)
*   **Edge Function Created (Prompt 3.1):** The `campaign-manager` Edge Function was created manually at `supabase/functions/campaign-manager/index.ts`.
*   **Backend Logic Implemented (Prompt 3.2):** The function was updated with `GET` and `POST` handlers to fetch and create campaigns in the database.
*   **Dashboard UI Built (Prompt 3.3):** A new dashboard page was created at `/dashboard` to display a user's campaigns in a table.
*   **Creation Form Implemented (Prompt 3.4):** The dashboard now features a "Create Campaign" button that opens a dialog form. Submitting this form successfully calls the Edge Function and updates the UI in real-time.

### Completed Phase 3.5: Authentication System Overhaul
*   **Problem:** Ran into persistent, critical authentication issues due to a deprecated Supabase library (`@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`).
*   **Solution:** Executed a full migration to the new `@supabase/ssr` library. This involved:
    *   Replacing the Supabase client, middleware, and auth callback route.
    *   Updating all pages to use the new client factory.
    *   Resolving numerous dependency conflicts and CORS issues.
    *   Applying correct Row Level Security to the `user_tokens` table.
*   **Outcome:** The authentication and user session management is now stable, secure, and aligned with current best practices.

### Completed Phase 4: Gmail API Integration & OAuth
*   **Database Table Created:** The `user_tokens` table was created to store user OAuth tokens securely and RLS policies were applied.
*   **Gmail Connection UI (Prompt 4.1):** The `/dashboard` page now dynamically shows a "Connect" card or the main dashboard.
*   **OAuth Initiated (Prompt 4.2):** Created the `gmail-auth-start` Edge Function to generate a Google consent screen URL and wired it up to the "Connect" button.
*   **OAuth Callback Created (Prompt 4.3):** Built the `/auth/callback/google` page to handle the redirect from Google.
*   **Token Exchange & Storage (Prompt 4.4):** Created the `gmail-auth-token` Edge Function. This function securely exchanges the auth code for a refresh token, encrypts it, and stores it in the database.

### Completed Phase 5: Email Authoring & Sending (Partial)
*   **AI Email Generation (Prompt 5.1):** Created the `generate-email-draft` Edge Function that integrates with OpenAI GPT-4 API and Comet Opik SDK for prompt logging and evaluation. The function generates personalized cold email drafts based on campaign goals and target audience.
*   **Email Composer UI (Prompt 5.2):** Built the campaign detail page at `/campaigns/[id]` with a comprehensive email composer interface. Features include:
    *   Campaign details display (name, goal, audience, creation date)
    *   Subject line and email body input fields
    *   "Generate with AI" button that calls the Edge Function
    *   "Send Email" button (placeholder for next step)
    *   Updated dashboard with clickable campaign links
*   **Send Email Functionality (Prompt 5.3):** Created the `send-email` Edge Function that:
    *   Retrieves and decrypts stored Gmail OAuth tokens
    *   Refreshes access tokens automatically
    *   Sends emails via Gmail API (`users.messages.send`)
    *   Saves email metadata (messageId, threadId) to the `emails` table
    *   Updated the campaign detail page with recipient email input and full send functionality

    *   Refreshes access tokens automatically
    *   Sends emails via Gmail API (`users.messages.send`)
    *   Saves email metadata (messageId, threadId) to the `emails` table
*   **Send Email UI Integration (Prompt 5.4):** Updated the campaign detail page with:
    *   Recipient email input field with validation
    *   "Send Email" button that invokes the `send-email` Edge Function
    *   Toast notifications for success/failure feedback
    *   Form clearing after successful send
    *   Loading states and proper error handling

### Completed Phase 5.5: Leads Management & Persistence
*   **Leads Table Created:** Added a `leads` table to the Supabase database with RLS policies to ensure user data isolation.
*   **Edge Function Deployed:** Created and deployed the `leads-manager` Edge Function to handle uploading, fetching, and deleting leads for each campaign.
*   **UI Updated for Lead Upload:** The campaign detail page now allows users to upload a CSV of leads, which are saved to the database and displayed in the UI with their status.
*   **Persistence Across Sessions:** Leads are always loaded from the database, ensuring they persist across page reloads, logouts, and logins.

### Completed Phase 6: Automated Reply Tracking & UI
*   **Reply Poller Function:** Created and deployed the `reply-poller` Edge Function.
*   **Function Scheduling:** Using `pg_cron` (enabled via the dashboard), the `reply-poller` is scheduled to run automatically every 10 minutes.
*   **`replies` Table Created:** A new `replies` table was created in the database to store the content of incoming email replies, secured with RLS policies.
*   **Core Reply Logic:** The `reply-poller` was implemented with the full logic to:
    *   Securely fetch and refresh user Gmail tokens.
    *   Use the Gmail API to scan email threads for new messages.
    *   Intelligently identify true replies and avoid processing duplicates.
    *   Update the status of the original email to `replied` in the `emails` table.
    *   Insert the new reply's content into the `replies` table.
*   **Email Status UI:**
    *   The `campaign-manager` function was updated to fetch all associated emails for each campaign.
    *   The campaign detail page now features a "Sent Emails" table that displays the recipient, subject, and a color-coded status (`Sent` or `Replied`) for every email in the campaign, providing a clear overview of outreach performance.

### Completed Phase 7: Interactive Reply Management & Follow-ups
*   **Reply Viewing and Tagging UI (Prompt 7.1):**
    *   The "Replied" rows in the Sent Emails table are now clickable.
    *   Clicking a row opens a dialog that displays the full reply content and the original email for context.
    *   The dialog includes UI for tagging the reply's outcome (`Positive`, `Neutral`, `Not interested`) and a textarea for saving notes.
*   **Tagging Backend (Prompt 7.2):**
    *   The `replies` table was updated with `outcome_tag` and `notes` columns.
    *   A new `tag-reply` Edge Function was created and deployed to save the user's tags and notes to the database.
    *   The "Save" button in the dialog is fully wired to this function, providing real-time feedback.
*   **AI Follow-up Generation (Prompt 7.3):**
    *   The `generate-email-draft` function was enhanced. It now accepts the original email thread context and user notes to generate intelligent, relevant follow-up drafts using OpenAI.
    *   A "Generate Follow-up Idea" button was added to the reply dialog, which calls this enhanced function and displays the resulting draft in a new textarea.
*   **Send Follow-up Functionality (Prompt 7.4):**
    *   The `send-email` function was upgraded to handle replies. It can now accept a `threadId` to ensure follow-up emails are correctly threaded in Gmail.
    *   A "Send Follow-up" button was added to the reply dialog. It calls the upgraded function, sending the AI-generated draft as a direct reply to the lead.

## Current Status & Next Steps

We have successfully completed **Phase 7: Interactive Reply Management & Follow-ups**.

*   **Next Action:** The project is now feature-complete according to the original `PLAN.md`. Next steps would involve refining the UI, adding more robust error handling, or beginning a new feature phase such as A/B testing or detailed analytics.
