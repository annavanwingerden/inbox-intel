# Recent Changes & Fixes

This document summarizes the recent debugging and feature implementation work.

## 1. Bug Fixes

### Leads Management (`leads-manager`)
- **Error:** `{"error":"Campaign ID is required"}` and `{"error":"Campaign ID and emails array are required"}`.
- **Root Cause:** A mismatch between the data being sent from the frontend and the data expected by the backend Edge Function. The frontend was sending `campaignId` (camelCase) and `leads`, while the backend expected `campaign_id` (snake_case) and `emails`.
- **Resolution:** The frontend code in `inbox-intel/src/app/campaigns/[id]/page.tsx` was updated to send the correct keys (`campaign_id` and `emails`) in the payload when uploading a CSV file.

### Email Sending (`send-email`)
- **Error:** `"Failed to save email metadata: null value in column "id" of relation "emails" violates not-null constraint"`.
- **Root Cause:** The `id` column of the `emails` table was not automatically generating a default UUID upon a new row insertion.
- **Resolution:** 
    1. The `send-email` function was temporarily modified to return more detailed database errors, which helped pinpoint the exact issue.
    2. An `ALTER TABLE` SQL command was executed via the MCP server to set the default value of the `id` column to `gen_random_uuid()`, ensuring all new emails get a unique ID automatically.

## 2. New Features

### Confetti on Email Send
- **Feature:** A celebratory confetti animation now triggers upon successful email sending.
- **Implementation:**
    - The `canvas-confetti` library was installed.
    - A `triggerConfetti` helper function was added to the campaign detail page (`inbox-intel/src/app/campaigns/[id]/page.tsx`).
    - This function is called immediately after a user successfully sends an email, providing positive visual feedback. 

### Automated Reply Polling (`reply-poller`)
- **Feature:** A scheduled Edge Function that runs periodically to check for new email replies. This is the foundation for automated reply tracking.
- **Implementation Steps as Prompts:**
    1.  **Create the Edge Function:**
        ```text
        Using the Supabase CLI, create a new Edge Function named `reply-poller`. Update its content to simply log "Polling for replies..." to the console.
        ```
    2.  **Deploy the Function:**
        ```text
        Deploy the new `reply-poller` function to your Supabase project. Deploy it with the `--no-verify-jwt` flag, as it will be invoked by an automated trigger, not a user.
        ```
    3.  **Enable the Cron Extension:**
        ```text
        In the Supabase Dashboard, navigate to Database > Extensions and enable the `pg_cron` extension.
        ```
    4.  **Schedule the Function:**
        ```text
        In the Supabase SQL Editor, run a SQL script to schedule an invocation of the `reply-poller` function every 10 minutes. This requires using `cron.schedule` to execute a `net.http_post` to the function's URL, including the project's anon key for authorization.
        ``` 

## 3. Post-Plan Bug Bash & Refinements

This section covers a series of rapid-fire bug fixes and user experience improvements made after the main features were implemented.

### `textarea.tsx` Missing Component
- **Error:** Application failed to build with the error `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/textarea'`.
- **Root Cause:** The `Textarea` component was used in the reply modal, but the corresponding component file had never been created.
- **Resolution:** The file `inbox-intel/src/components/ui/textarea.tsx` was created and populated with the standard source code for the Shadcn UI Textarea component.

### Inefficient Lead Fetching
- **Issue:** The `leads-manager` function was being called on every campaign page load, creating unnecessary network requests.
- **Resolution:**
    1. The automatic call to `fetchLeads()` was removed from the main `useEffect` hook.
    2. A "View Uploaded Leads" button was added to the UI. The `fetchLeads()` function is now only called when this button is clicked.
    3. A new state, `hasAttemptedFetchLeads`, was added to provide clear feedback to the user if they click the button and no leads exist for that campaign.

### Leads `GET` Request Failing
- **Error:** Clicking "View Uploaded Leads" resulted in a `400 Bad Request` error.
- **Root Cause:** The frontend was sending the `campaign_id` in the request body, but the backend `GET` endpoint expected it as a URL query parameter.
- **Resolution:** The `fetchLeads` function was updated to pass the `campaign_id` directly in the function URL string: `supabase.functions.invoke(\`leads-manager?campaign_id=\${campaignId}\`, ...)`.

### Leads CSV Upload Failing
- **Error:** Uploading a CSV returned a generic `500 Internal Server Error`.
- **Root Cause:** The `leads` table did not exist in the Supabase database. The `leads-manager` function was crashing when it tried to insert rows into a non-existent table.
- **Resolution:** The user created the table by running the `create_leads_table.sql` script directly in the Supabase SQL Editor, which immediately resolved the issue.

### AI Draft Generation Failing
- **Error:** Clicking "Generate Email Draft" resulted in the error `{"error":"campaignId is not defined"}`.
- **Root Cause:** A recent refactor of the `generate-email-draft` function to support follow-ups had accidentally removed `campaignId` from the list of destructured request body properties, but it was still being used for logging.
- **Resolution:** The `campaignId` was added back to the request body destructuring in the `generate-email-draft` function, and the function was redeployed.
